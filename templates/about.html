        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <p>
                Thorin II Oakenshield is the Leader of the Company, the King of Durin's Folk and former Prince of
                Erebor, has many of the speaking roles and is known for combat achievements, killing Orcs on countless
                occasions. He often acts in a confrontational manner, but is a great leader among the Dwarves.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and apart from Balin, and possibly
                Bombur, they appeared more frequently as "individual" characters in Tolkien's novel than the rest of
                Thorin's companions, who were most often named only in "group" references to the entire company.
